=============================================================================
1. Introduction                                 *gutentags-intro*

Gutentags is a plugin that takes care of the much needed management of tags
files in Vim. It will (re)generate tag files as you work while staying
completely out of your way. It will even do its best to keep those tag files
out of your way too. It has no dependencies and just works.

In order to generate tag files, Gutentags will have to figure out what's in
your project. To do this, it will locate well-known project root markers like
SCM folders (.git, .hg, etc.), any custom tags you define (with
|gutentags_project_root|), and even things you may have defined already with
other plugins, like CtrlP.

If the current file you're editing is found to be in such a project, Gutentags
will make sure the tag file for that project is up to date. Then, as you work
in files in that project, it will partially re-generate the tag file. Every
time you save, it will silently, in the background, update the tags for that
file.

Usually, `ctags` can only append tags to an existing tag file, so Gutentags
removes the tags for the current file first, to make sure the tag file is
always consistent with the source code.

Also, Gutentags is clever enough to not stumble upon itself by triggering
multiple ctags processes if you save files too fast, or if your project is
really big.


1.1 Requirements
                                                *gutentags-ctags-requirements*

If you're using the `ctags` modules (which is the default and only working one
at this point, really), you will need a `tags` generator that supports the
following arguments:

* `-f` (to specify the output file)
* `--append` (to append to an existing file while keeping it sorted)
* `--exclude` (to exclude file patterns)
* `--options` (to specify an options file)

This means you probably want Exuberant Ctags or Universal Ctags. The basic
old BSD Ctags WON'T WORK. Other language-specific versions may or may not
work. Check with their help or man page.


1.2 Similar Plugins
                                                *gutentags-similar-plugins*

There are some similar Vim plugins out there ("vim-tags", "vim-autotag",
"vim-automatic-ctags", etc.). They all fail on one or more of the requirements
I set for myself with Gutentags:

* No other dependency than running Vim: no Python, Ruby, or whatever.
* Cross-platform: should work on at least Mac and Windows.
* Incremental tags generation: don't re-generate the whole project all the
  time. This may be fine for small projects, but it doesn't scale.
* External process management: if the ctags process is taking a long time,
  don't run another one because I saved the file again.
* Keep the tag file consistent: don't just append the current file's tags to
  the tag file, otherwise you will still "see" tags for deleted or renamed
  classes and functions.
* Automatically create the tag file: you open something from a freshly forked
  project, it should start indexing it automatically, just like in Sublime Text 
  or Visual Studio or any other IDE.


=============================================================================
2. Commands                                     *gutentags-commands*

                                                *gutentags-project-commands*
The following commands are only available in buffers that have been found to
belong to a project that should be managed by Gutentags. See
|gutentags_project_root| for how Gutentags figures out the project a file
belongs to. When no project is found (i.e. the file is not under any of the
known project markers), Gutentags is disabled for that buffer, and the
following commands and remarks don't apply.

If you want to force-disable Gutentags for a given project even though it does
match one of the items in |gutentags_project_root|, create a file named
"`.notags`" at the root of the project.

The tag file that Gutentags creates and manages will be named after
|gutentags_ctags_tagfile|, relative to the project's root directory. When
Gutentags finds a valid project root, it will prepend the tag file's path to
'tags', unless |gutentags_ctags_auto_set_tags| is set to 0. This is to make
sure Vim will use that file first.

If a file managed by Gutentags is opened and no tag file already exists,
Gutentags will start generating it right away in the background, unless 
|gutentags_generate_on_missing| is set to 0. If you have a large project, you
may want to know when Gutentags is generating tags: see
|gutentags-status-line| to display an indicator in your status line.

When a file managed by Gutentags is saved, the tag file will be incrementally
updated, i.e. references to the recently saved file are removed, and that file
is re-parsed for tags, with the result being merged into the tag file. This
makes the tag file 100% consistent with the latest changes. This doesn't
happen however if |gutentags_generate_on_write| is set to 0, in which case you
have to run |GutentagsUpdate| manually.


                                                *:GutentagsUpdate*
:GutentagsUpdate
                        Forces an update of the current tag file with the
                        current buffer. If tags are already being generated,
                        you will be notified and the command will abort.

:GutentagsUpdate!
                        Like |GutentagsUpdate|, but updates the current tags
                        file with the whole project instead of just the
                        current buffer.


Some debugging/troubleshooting commands are also available if the
|gutentags_define_advanced_commands| global setting is set to 1.

                                                *:GutentagsToggleEnabled*
:GutentagsToggleEnabled
                        Disables and re-enables Gutentags.
                        When Gutentags is disabled, it won't update your tag
                        file when you save a buffer. It will however still
                        look for project markers as you open new buffers so
                        that they can start working again when you re-enable
                        Gutentags.

                        {only available when
                        |gutentags_define_advanced_commands| is set}

                                                *GutentagsToggleTrace*
:GutentagsToggleTrace
                        If you want to keep an eye on what Gutentags is doing,
                        you can enable tracing. This will show messages every
                        time Gutentags does something. It can get annoying
                        quickly, since it will require you to press a key to
                        dismiss those messages, but it can be useful to
                        troubleshoot a problem.
                        In addition to messages in Vim, it will also make
                        Gutentags redirect the output of the tag generation
                        script to a `.log` file in the project root.

                        {only available when
                        |gutentags_define_advanced_commands| is set}


Gutentags also has some user auto-commands (see |User| and |:doautocmd|):

                                                *GutentagsUpdating*
GutentagsUpdating
                        This auto-command is triggered when a background
                        update job has started.

                                                *GutentagsUpdated*
GutentagsUpdated
                        This auto-command is triggered when a background
                        update job has finished.


=============================================================================
3.  Status Line                                 *gutentags-status-line*

Tag file generation can take a while if you're working on a project big
enough. In that case, you may want to know when `ctags` is running, so you
have a heads up if some of the tags aren't recognized yet.

                                                *gutentags#statusline()*
You can display an indicator of tag generation progress in your |status-line|
with the following function: >
        :set statusline+=%{gutentags#statusline()}

The function will, by default, print a list of modules in the status line. So
if the `ctags` module (see |g:gutentags_modules|) is currently generating
a tags file, you will see "ctags" printed in the status line. If nothing is
happening, nothing will be printed in the status line.

You can pass some parameters to customize this:

1. A prefix string (defaults to `""`).
2. A suffix string (defaults to `""`).
3. The text to print (defaults to the names of modules currently generating
   something).

So using `gutentags#statusline('[', ']')` would print `"[ctags]"` instead of
`"ctags"`.

Because Gutentags runs the tag generation in the background, the statusline
indicator might stay there even after the background process has ended. It
would only go away when Vim decides to refresh the statusline. You can force
refresh it in a callback on |GutentagsUpdating| and |GutentagsUpdated|.

For instance, with the `lightline` plugin:

        augroup MyGutentagsStatusLineRefresher
            autocmd!
            autocmd User GutentagsUpdating call lightline#update()
            autocmd User GutentagsUpdated call lightline#update()
        augroup END

                                                *gutentags#statusline_cb*
As an alternative to the previous function, `gutentags#statusline_cb` takes
a single parameter which should be a |Funcref| or a function name. This
function should take a list of active module names, and return a string. This
lets you completely control what the status line will print.

For instance:
        function! s:get_gutentags_status(mods) abort
            let l:msg = ''
            if index(a:mods, 'ctags') >= 0
               let l:msg .= '♨'
             endif
             if index(a:mods, 'cscope') >= 0
               let l:msg .= '♺'
             endif
             return l:msg
        endfunction

        :set statusline+=%{gutentags#statusline_cb(
                    \function('<SID>get_gutentags_status'))}

By default, the callback function doesn't get called if no tags generation is
currently happening. You can pass `1` as a second argument so that the
callback function is always called.


=============================================================================
4. Global Settings                              *gutentags-settings*

The following settings can be defined in your |vimrc| to change the default
behaviour of Gutentags.

                                                *gutentags_enabled*
g:gutentags_enabled
                        Defines whether Gutentags should be enabled. When
                        disabled, Gutentags will still scan for project root
                        markers when opening buffers. This is so that when you
                        re-enable Gutentags, you won't have some buffers
                        mysteriously working while others (those open last)
                        don't.
                        Defaults to `1`.

                                                *gutentags_trace*
g:gutentags_trace
                        When true, Gutentags will spit out debugging
                        information as Vim messages (which you can later read
                        with |:messages|). It also runs its background scripts
                        with extra parameters to log activity to a `tags.log`
                        file that you can also inspect for more information.

                        Note: you can run `:verbose GutentagsUpdate` to
                        temporarily set |g:gutentags_trace| to `1` for that
                        update only.

                        Defaults to `0`.

                                                *gutentags_dont_load*
g:gutentags_dont_load
                        Prevents Gutentags from loading at all on Vim startup.

                        The difference between this and |gutentags_enabled| is
                        that |gutentags_enabled| can be turned on and off in
                        the same Vim session -- Gutentags as a plugin stays
                        loaded and will keep track of what happened while it
                        was disabled. However, |gutentags_dont_load| only
                        works on Vim startup and will prevent Gutentags from
                        loading at all, as if it wasn't there.

                                                *gutentags_modules*
g:gutentags_modules
                        A list of modules to load with Gutentags. Each module
                        is responsible for generating a specific type of tags
                        file.
                        Valid values are:

                        - `ctags`: generates a `tags` file using
                          a `ctags`-compatible program like Exhuberant Ctags
                          or Universal Ctags.

                        - `cscope`: generates a code database file using
                          `cscope`.

                        - `pycscope`: generates a code database file using
                          `pycscope`.

                        - `gtags_cscope`: same as `cscope` but uses GNU's
                          `gtags` executable and database.

                        - `cscope_maps`: same as `cscope`. Supports
                        `cscope_maps.nvim`.

                        Defaults to `[ctags]`.

                                                *gutentags_project_root*
g:gutentags_project_root
                        When a buffer is loaded, Gutentags will figure out if
                        it's part of a project that should have tags managed
                        automatically. To do this, it looks for "root markers"
                        in the current file's directory and its parent
                        directories. If it finds any of those markers,
                        Gutentags will be enabled for the project, and a tags
                        file named after |gutentags_ctags_tagfile| will be 
                        created at the project root.
                        Defaults to `[]` (an empty |List|).
                        A list of default markers will be appended to the
                        user-defined ones unless
                        |gutentags_add_default_project_roots| is set to 0.

                                            *gutentags_add_default_project_roots*
g:gutentags_add_default_project_roots
                        Defines whether Gutentags should always define some
                        default project roots (see |gutentags_project_root|).
                        This can be useful to prevent unnecessary disk access
                        when Gutentags searches for a project root.
                        The default markers are:
                        `['.git', '.hg', '.svn', '.bzr', '_darcs', '_darcs', '_FOSSIL_', '.fslckout']`

                                            *gutentags_add_ctrlp_root_markers*
g:gutentags_add_ctrlp_root_markers
                        If Gutentags finds `g:ctrlp_root_markers` (used by the
                        CtrlP plugin), it will append those root markers to
                        the existing ones (see |g:gutentags_project_root|).
                        Set this to 0 to stop it from happening.
                        Defaults to 1.

                                                *gutentags_exclude_filetypes*
g:gutentags_exclude_filetypes
                        A |List| of file types (see |'filetype'|) that Gutentags
                        should ignore. When a buffer is opened, if its
                        'filetype' is found in this list, Gutentags features
                        won't be available for this buffer.
                        Defaults to an empty list (`[]`).

                                                *gutentags_exclude_project_root*
g:gutentags_exclude_project_root
                        A list of project roots to generally ignore. If a file
                        is opened inside one of those projects, Gutentags
                        won't be activated. This is similar to placing
                        a `.notags` file in the root of those projects, but
                        can be useful when you don't want to, or can't, place
                        such a file there.
                        Defaults to `['/usr/local', '/opt/homebrew', '/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew']`,
                        which are the folders where Homebrew is known to
                        create a Git repository by default.

                                                *gutentags_project_root_finder*
g:gutentags_project_root_finder
                        When a buffer is loaded, Gutentags uses a default
                        (internal) implementation to find that file's
                        project's root directory, using settings like
                        |g:gutentags_project_root|. When you specify
                        |g:gutentags_project_root_finder|, you can tell
                        Gutentags to use a custom implementation, such as
                        `vim-projectroot`. The value of this setting must be
                        the name of a function that takes a single string
                        argument (the path to the current buffer's file) and
                        returns a string value (the project's root directory).
                        Defaults to `''`.
                        Note: when set, the called implementation will
                        possibly ignore |g:gutentags_project_root|.
                        Note: an implementation can fallback to the default
                        behaviour by calling
                        `gutentags#default_get_project_root`.

                                                *gutentags_always_absolute*
g:gutentags_always_absolute
                        Always resolve tags file as absolute, even if tags
                        file is local.
                        Defaults to 0.

                                                *gutentags_generate_on_missing*
g:gutentags_generate_on_missing
                        If set to 1, Gutentags will start generating an initial
                        tag file if a file is open in a project where no tags
                        file is found. See |gutentags_project_root| for how
                        Gutentags locates the project.
                        When set to 0, Gutentags will only generate the first
                        time the file is saved (if
                        |gutentags_generate_on_write| is set to 1), or when
                        |GutentagsUpdate| or |GutentagsGenerate| is run.
                        Defaults to 1.

                                                *gutentags_generate_on_new*
g:gutentags_generate_on_new
                        If set to 1, Gutentags will start generating the tag
                        file when a new project is open. A new project is
                        considered open when a buffer is created for a file
                        whose corresponding tag file has not been "seen" yet
                        in the current Vim session -- which pretty much means
                        when you open the first file in a given source control
                        repository.
                        When set to 0, Gutentags won't do anything special.
                        See also |gutentags_generate_on_missing| and
                        |gutentags_generate_on_write|.
                        Defaults to 1.

                                                *gutentags_generate_on_write*
g:gutentags_generate_on_write
                        If set to 1, Gutentags will update the current
                        project's tag file when a file inside that project is
                        saved. See |gutentags_project_root| for how Gutentags
                        locates the project.
                        When set to 0, Gutentags won't do anything on save.
                        This means that the project's tag file won't reflect
                        the latest changes, and you will have to run
                        |GutentagsUpdate| manually.
                        Defaults to 1.

                                            *gutentags_generate_on_empty_buffer*
g:gutentags_generate_on_empty_buffer
                        If set to 1, Gutentags will start generating the tag
                        file even if there's no buffer currently open, as long
                        as the current working directory (as returned by
                        |:cd|) is inside a known project.
                        This is useful if you want Gutentags to generate the
                        tag file right after opening Vim.
                        Defaults to 0.

                                                *gutentags_background_update*
g:gutentags_background_update
                        Specifies whether the process that updates the tags
                        file should be run in the background or in the
                        foreground. If run in the foreground, Vim will block
                        until the process is complete.
                        Defaults to 1.

                                                *gutentags_cache_dir*
g:gutentags_cache_dir
                        Specifies a directory in which to create all the tags
                        files, instead of writing them at the root of each
                        project. This is handy to keep tags files from
                        polluting many directories all across your computer.

                                            *gutentags_resolve_symlinks*
g:gutentags_resolve_symlinks
                        When set to 1, Gutentags will resolve any symlinks in
                        the current buffer's path in order to find the project
                        it belongs to. This is what you want if you're editing
                        a symlink located outside of the project, and it
                        points to a file inside the project. However, this is
                        maybe not what you want if the symlink itself is
                        part of the project.
                        Defaults to 0.
                        
                                            *gutentags_init_user_func*
g:gutentags_init_user_func
                        When set to a non-empty string, it is expected to be
                        the name of a function that will be called when a file
                        is opened in a project. The function gets passed the
                        path of the file and if it returns 0, Gutentags won't
                        be enabled for that file.

                        You can use this to manually set buffer-local
                        settings:
                        
                        * `b:gutentags_ctags_tagfile` (see |gutentags_ctags_tagfile|).

                        This setting was previously called 
                        `gutentags_enabled_user_func`. The old setting is
                        still used as a fallback.

                        Defaults to "".

                                            *gutentags_define_advanced_commands*
g:gutentags_define_advanced_commands
                        Defines some advanced commands like
                        |GutentagsToggleEnabled| and |GutentagsUnlock|.

                                            *gutentags_project_info*
g:gutentags_project_info
                        Defines ways for Gutentags to figure out what kind of
                        project any given file belongs to. This should be
                        a list of dictionaries:

                        let g:gutentags_project_info = []
                        call add(g:gutentags_project_info, {...})

                        Each dictionary item must contain at least a `type`
                        key, indicating the type of project:

                        {"type": "python"}

                        Other items will be used to figure out if a project is
                        of the given type.

                        "file": any existing file with this path (relative to
                        the project root) will make the current project match
                        the given info.

                        "glob": any result found with this glob pattern
                        (relative to the project root) will make the current
                        project match the given info. See |glob()| for more
                        information.

                        Gutentags adds by default the following definitions:

                        call add(g:gutentags_project_info, {'type': 'python', 'file': 'setup.py'})
                        call add(g:gutentags_project_info, {'type': 'ruby', 'file': 'Gemfile'})

                        This means, for example, that you can use
                        `g:gutentags_ctags_executable_ruby` out of the box.
                        See |gutentags_ctags_executable_{filetype}| for more
                        information.

                                            *gutentags_file_list_command*
g:gutentags_file_list_command
                        Specifies command(s) to use to list files for which
                        tags should be generated, instead of recursively
                        examining all files within the project root. When
                        invoked, file list commands will execute in the
                        project root directory.

                        This setting is useful in projects using source
                        control to restrict tag generation to only files
                        tracked in the repository.

                        This variable may be set in one of two ways. If
                        set as a |String|, the specified command will be used to
                        list files for all projects. For example: >

                         let g:gutentags_file_list_command = 'find . -type f'
<
                        If set as a |Dictionary|, this variable should be set
                        as a mapping of project root markers to the desired
                        file list command for that root marker. (See
                        |gutentags_project_root| for how Gutentags uses root
                        markers to locate the project.) For example: >

                         let g:gutentags_file_list_command = {
                             \ 'markers': {
                                 \ '.git': 'git ls-files',
                                 \ '.hg': 'hg files',
                                 \ },
                             \ }
<
                        Note: If a custom ctags executable is specified, it
                        must support the '-L' command line option in order to
                        read the list of files to be examined.


The following settings are valid for the `ctags` module.

                                                *gutentags_ctags_executable*
g:gutentags_ctags_executable
                        Specifies the ctags executable to launch.
                        Defaults to `ctags`.

                                     *gutentags_ctags_executable_{filetype}*
g:gutentags_ctags_executable_{type}
                        Specifies the ctags executable to launch for a project
                        of type {type}. See |gutentags_project_info| for more
                        information.
                        IMPORTANT: please see |gutentags-ctags-requirements|.
                        Example: >
                         let g:gutentags_ctags_executable_ruby = 'ripper-tags'
<

                                                *gutentags_ctags_tagfile*
g:gutentags_ctags_tagfile
                        Specifies the name of the tag file to create. This
                        will be appended to the project's root. See
                        |gutentags_project_root| for how Gutentags locates the
                        project.
                        Defaults to `tags`.

                                                *gutentags_ctags_exclude*
g:gutentags_ctags_exclude
                        A list of file patterns to pass to the
                        |gutentags_ctags_executable| so that they will be
                        excluded from parsing for the tags generation.
                        See also |gutentags_ctags_exclude_wildignore|.
                        Defaults to `[]` (an empty |List|).

                                                *gutentags_ctags_exclude_wildignore*
g:gutentags_ctags_exclude_wildignore
                        When 1, Gutentags will automatically pass your
                        'wildignore' file patterns to the 
                        |gutentags_ctags_executable| so that they are ignored.
                        Set also |gutentags_ctags_exclude| to pass custom
                        patterns.
                        Defaults to 1.

                                                *gutentags_ctags_auto_set_tags*
g:gutentags_ctags_auto_set_tags
                        If set to 1, Gutentags will automatically prepend
                        'tags' with the exact path to the tag file for the
                        current project. See |gutentags_project_root| for how
                        Gutentags locates the project.
                        When set to 0, Gutentags doesn't change 'tags', and
                        this means that whatever tag file it generates may
                        not be picked up by Vim. See |tagfiles()| to know what
                        tag files Vim knows about.
                        Defaults to 1.

                                                *gutentags_ctags_extra_args*
g:gutentags_ctags_extra_args
                        A list of arguments to pass to `ctags`.
                        Defaults to `[]`.

                                                *gutentags_ctags_post_process_cmd*
g:gutentags_ctags_post_process_cmd
                        If defined, the tags generation script will run the
                        command with an argument that points to a temporary
                        copy of the tags file. If the post-process step is
                        modifying the tags file, it needs to do so in-place.
                        This is useful for cleaning up a tags file that may
                        contain tags with non-ASCII names that somehow upsets
                        Vim.
                        Defaults to `""` (an empty |String|).


The following settings are valid for the `cscope` module.

                                                *gutentags_cscope_executable*
g:gutentags_cscope_executable
                        Specifies the name or path of the `cscope` executable
                        to use to generate the code database.
                        Defaults to `"cscope"`.

                                                *gutentags_scopefile*
g:gutentags_scopefile
                        Specifies the name of the scope file to create. This
                        will be appended to the project's root. See
                        |gutentags_project_root| for how Gutentags locates the
                        project.
                        Defaults to `"cscope.out"`.

                                                *gutentags_auto_add_cscope*

                        If set to 1, Gutentags will automatically add the
                        generated code database to Vim by running `:cs add`
                        (see |:cscope|).
                        Defaults to 1.

                                                *gutentags_cscope_build_inverted_index*
g:gutentags_cscope_build_inverted_index
                        If set to 1, Gutentags will make `cscope` build an
                        inverted index.
                        Defaults to 0.


The following settings are valid for the `pycscope` module.

                                                *gutentags_pycscope_executable*
g:gutentags_pycscope_executable
                        Specifies the name or path of the `pycscope` executable

                        If set to 1, Gutentags will automatically add the
                        generated code database to Vim by running `:cs add`
                        (see |:pycscope|).
                        Defaults to 1.


The following settings are valid for the `gtags_cscope` module.

                                                *gutentags_gtags_executable*
g:gutentags_gtags_executable
                        Specifies the name or path of the `gtags` executable
                        to use to generate the code database.
                        Defaults to `"gtags"`.

                                                *gutentags_gtags_cscope_executable*

                        Path from the cache directory (|gutentags_cache_dir|
                        or project root) to the folder containing the
                        definition database file (usually called `GTAGS`).
                        Defaults to `""`.

                                                *gutentags_gtags_options_file*
g:gutentags_gtags_options_file
                        The name of a file that will be looked for in
                        a project root directory. The file is expected to
                        contain `gtags` options (one per line).
                        Defaults to `".gutgtags"`.

                        (see |:cscope|).
                        Defaults to 1.


People using `cscope`, `pycscope` or `gtags_cscope` across multiple projects in the same
Vim instance might be interested in the `gutentags_plus` plugin, which handles
switching databases automatically before performing a query.

5. Project Settings                             *gutentags-project-settings*

Gutentags can be customized to some extent on a per-project basis with the
following files present in the project root directory:

                                                *gutentags-.gutctags*
`.gutctags`: if this file exists, Ctags will be told to load additional
command-line parameters by reading it line by line (see the Ctags
documentation for more information). This will override the default options
file, which adds `--recurse=yes`, so unless you are using
|gutentags_file_list_command| you will want to include `--recurse=yes` in your
`.gutctags` file.

Note that for complex reasons, Gutentags can't run `ctags` from the project
root if you're using |gutentags_cache_dir|, so if the `.gutctags` file exists,
it will be pre-processed in order to make all `--exclude=` clauses into
absolute paths (by prepending the project root). The resulting file will be
saved into the cache directory, and passed to `ctags` via the `--options=`
parameter. If you're _not_ using |gutentags_cache_dir|, the `.gutctags` file
is _not_ pre-processed, and is passed as-is via the `--options=` parameter.

                                                *gutentags-.notags*
`.notags`: if this file exists, Gutentags will be disabled completely for that
project.
